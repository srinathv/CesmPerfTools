Research project allocations begin on calendar quarters, are normally for one year, and must be renewed annually for multi-year projects. Requests for new research allocations and renewals must be submitted 30 days prior to the start of the allocation period. Requests submitted after the due date will be considered for the next allocation period. PIs can apply for startup project allocations until the next research project quarterly deadline. Multi-year research project allocations can be granted as part of proposal submission by negotiation with TACC during proposal preparation. Such multi-year allocations are also reviewed annually to ensure continued need and effective utilization of the resource."
